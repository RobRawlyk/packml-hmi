                <span>Part 6 in the series of PackML Implementation Guidelines. Targeting the engineers </span>
                <span>responsible for machine design, the contents of this part will establish standards </span>
                <span>and best practices in the areas of interaction and interface design. Coverage offers </span>

            <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>
            <hr class="black"/>
            <h3>2.1 Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0002] It is generaly accepted that production lines with widely varying HMI designs </span>
                <span>will suffer from reduced operator efficiency. It follows that this lack of </span>
                <span>efficiency will lead to longer downtime events, lower throughput, and reduced job satisfaction. </span>
                <span>To help counter these issues, the following guidance will establish a set of Human-Machine </span>
                <span>Interface implementation standards that, when employed by packaging machinery designers, </span>
                <span>will establish the consistency necessary to accommodate the specific needs of the packaging-line operator.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0003] In addition to the standards established in this document, the guidance will communicate </span>
                <span>a collection of more generic interface design best practices. We argue that the general level of </span>
                <span>usability within machine HMIs can always be improved. Accordingly, this document will provide </span>
                <span>guidance in the areas of usability and graphic design, which should benefit design engineers </span>
                <span>seeking to expand their background in those disciplines. </span>
            </p>        
            <p>
                <span>[0004] To accompany the recommendations offered throughout, this guideline presents a collection </span>
                <span>of reference material from which many of the best practices have been established. Readers are </span>
                <span>encouraged to explore these references, particularly those that fall outside the scope of </span>
                <span>their primary discipline. Throughout, an underlying theme will become evident; </span>
                <span>the designer is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the operator. Put bluntly, the </span>
                <span>operator's inability to comprehend or effectively use an interface is the fault of the designer. Errors </span>
                <span>incurred due to flawed design are not the responsibility of the operator, but are instead, </span>
                <span>evidence of a failure on the part of the designer. It is our expectation that readers of </span>
                <span>this guidance are willing to accept that responsibility and do their best to optimize </span>
                <span>their operator's experience.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0005] Success in the above endeavor, however, is not possible if designers work in isolation. </span>
                <span>Designers must collaborate with operators to understand their goals and the environment </span>
                <span>in which they work. Additionally, designers must collaborate with their peers to examine their work </span>
                <span>with a critical eye and to better understand successful designs and the underlying mechanisms that </span>
                <span>help achieve the desired outcome. The recommendations provided here advocate these additional steps as </span>
                <span>they are essential to the development of optimally usable designs.</span>
            </p>    
            <h3>2.2 Goals</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0006] As stated previously, this guidance is targeted at designers for the benefit of operators. </span>
                <span>By improving the environment in which operators work, producers will ideally realize </span>
                <span>reductions in downtime, increased throughput, lower levels of rework, and operators with higher </span>
                <span>levels of job satisfaction. Moreover, standardization in specific areas of the Human-Machine interface </span>
                <span>should aid in the development of cross-functional packaging operators that can move from production line to </span>
                <span>production line with greater efficiency.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0007] The best practices offered throughout are provided to encourage continous improvement on </span>
                <span>the part of system designers. Our ability to effectively communicate with our operators </span>
                <span>through the equipment we design can always be improved. The provided guidance is </span>
                <span>simply a starting point for designers seeking additional exposure to the usability and graphic </span>
                <span>design disciplines. Proper application of the provided recommendations is ultimately dependent on the context in question; </span>
                <span>evaluating the resulting designs via operator testing is essential. Getting it right the first time is a lofty goal, but </span>
                <span>getting it right is paramount. With a greater understanding and ability to control the way operator's </span>
                <span>experience the equipment we design, it is expected that &ndash; as designers &ndash; we will likewise experience </span>
                <span>greater job satisfaction.</span>
            </p>
            <h2>3. Background</h3>
            <hr class="black"/>
            <h3>3.1 Operator Empathy</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0008] In order to appropriately design machines that will ultimately meet the needs of the operator, </span>
                <span>we must first establish the characteristics that are critical to success.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0009] The first relevant operational characteristic, which distinguishes packaging equipment operators </span>
                <span>from most commercial product users, is the high likelihood that the operator is not present when </span>
                <span>feedback is provided by the machine. The operator responsible for multiple machines does not </span>
                <span>simply stand by and monitor a single HMI. When a downtime event is triggered by a specific machine </span>
                <span>in a complex line, it is highly likely that the operator is not present. Accordingly, effectively </span>
                <span>communicating with an operator that arrives after a critical event occurs will prove to be an essential skill.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0010] The downtime example is further complicated by the urgency of the situation. If a machine is down, the </span>
                <span>producer is losing money. This additional urgency increases the cognitive load experienced by the operator. </span>
                <span>It is reasonable to argue that the likelihood of interface-manipulation errors will increase under these </span>
                <span>conditions. Poor design is more easily accommodated under normal conditions. The added stress of abnormal </span>
                <span>conditions amplifies the impact of flawed designs. Accordingly, the designer must take care to consider the conditions </span>
                <span>and environment under which their operators perform.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0011] The associated goals and context in which operators work should be in the forefront of the designer's mind </span>
                <span>as each HMI decision is made. Understanding and empathizing with the operator is a great motivator for </span>
                <span>the engaged designer.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>3.2 Usability Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0012] With a handful of critical operator characteristics understood, it is next important to establish the scope </span>
                <span>of the term usability. Nielsen (1993) presents a set of usability characteristics to help clarify the concept; the </span>
                <span>usability of a machine is a function of its a) Learnability, b) Memorability, c) Efficiency, d) Fault Restistance </span>
                <span>and Tolerance, and d) the level of Satisfaction experienced by the operator.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0013] In the context of the packaging operator, Learnability, obviously, is most relevant to the new line operator. </span>
                <span>Here, the operator's ability to quickly build fluency in the associated Human-Machine Interface is a key measure </span>
                <span>of the designer's success. Similarly, an operator's ability to become productive when transitioning from one </span>
                <span>machine to another is a function of the new machine's Learnability level. It is our expectation that </span>
                <span>the standardization initiatives established in this guideline will increase the Learnability of any </span>
                <span>machines adopting the standards.</span>
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span>[0014] Learnability is generally measured by presenting new users with a task to perform using the interface. </span>
                <span>The time required to complete the task is a reasonable quantitative metric. When compared to an alternate </span>
                <span>design, the magnitude of the improvement attributed to the new design will help validate the design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0015] In a well functioning production line, it is likely that an operator will have infrequent interactions </span>
                <span>with the HMI. When the operator returns to a machine after a prolonged absence, the Memorability of </span>
                <span>the HMI becomes the focal point. Will the operator need to relearn the interface or is there some level of </span>
                <span>retention that allows a returning user to return to productivity more quickly than a new user?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0016] Maintaining the downtime example discussed earlier, an operator's ability to quickly identify and </span>
                <span>resolve an event is a perfect demonstration of the Efficiency characteristic. If instead, the operator must struggle </span>
                <span>through multiple steps with uncertainty and confusion, the downtime event will likely persist for an </span>
                <span>unacceptable period. When considered as raw metrics, the Efficiency of a packaging machine is best </span>
                <span>characterized in terms of the time necessary to complete specific tasks. While it is often argued that the </span>
                <span>number of steps taken (e.g., taps, key presses) is a worthwhile metric, we argue that a single step that </span>
                <span>takes 5 minutes due to operator uncertainty is much less efficient than 50 steps that require minimal </span>
                <span>thought and take 10 seconds. While a lowering the number of required steps is a worthy objective, time </span>
                <span>to completion is usually the more important goal in the packaging context. Measuring efficiency often </span>
                <span>warrants some amount of task repetition. During such testing, the first few iterations will actually </span>
                <span>constitute a measure of learnability. Once the task is learned, a more accurate measure of efficiency </span>
                <span>can be achieved.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0017] A system that helps operators avoid errors will likely pay dividends in both the Efficiency and </span>
                <span>Satisfaction contexts. Extra, unecessary HMI steps performed due to uncertainty on the part of </span>
                <span>the operator are a prime example of waste when considered from the lean manufacturing viewpoint. </span>
                <span>Producing designs that minimize such waste achieve the objective of Fault Resistance. Similarly, </span>
                <span>a system that can recover quickly from other errors (e.g., undo to recover from accidentally </span>
                <span>deleting a product configuration) warrants points in the Fault Tolerance category. Again, this </span>
                <span>characteristic clearly impacts the Efficiency and Satisfaction measures.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0018] While the Learnability, Memorability, Efficency, and Fault Awareness characteristics are well </span>
                <span>aligned with quantitative metrics, the Satisfaction characteristic is much more qualitative in </span>
                <span>nature. Norman (2003) addressed the ambiguity of Satisfaction by offering the Visceral, </span>
                <span>Reflective, and Behavioral characteristics. MORE CONTENT TO FOLLOW</span>

            <h3>3.3 Situational Awareness</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0019] Given the previously discussed usability characterisics, it is next necessary to consider how a </span>
                <span>given machine can effectively (a) communicate a condition and (b) direct the operator to the appropriate </span>
                <span>course of action. Endsley (1995) offers a model for Situational Awareness (SA) that breaks such interactions </span>
                <span>into levels. First, the model declares that the operator must perceive a given condition. Perception could be </span>
                <span>via a horn, a stack light, a message on a display, a pile of products on the production floor, or </span>
                <span>the smell of burning plastic. Having achieved Level 1 SA, the operator must then appropriately </span>
                <span>interpret the situation. What does the light mean? Why are there items on the floor? What's that </span>
                <span>smell? Finally, after Level 2 SA is achieved, the operator must project the current situation into the future. Perhaps the light </span>
                <span>is only a warning indicator that requires action to prevent a less desirable outcome. At this stage, </span>
                <span>the operator has achieved Level 3 SA and must make a decision to, optionally, perform some course of action. </span>
                <span>Ideally, this awareness is not flawed and contains no level of uncertainty. The appropriateness of the response </span>
                <span>is contingent on the effectiveness at each subsequent level. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0020] The designer is resposible for ensuring that the situational awareness is not flawed and contains </span>
                <span>minimal uncertainty. If the operator does not perceive the light because it is obscured from </span>
                <span>their vantage point, they have no reason to consider its meaning. Or, perhaps, a horn from a </span>
                <span>different line distracted their attention. Ensuring that the stimulus is effectively percieved </span>
                <span>is the first challenge.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0021] Comprehension of the situation with respect to the operator's goals is the next challenge. Given </span>
                <span>a fully integrated production line and a standard stack light convention, the operator will be </span>
                <span>responsible for monitoring the lights on the entire production line. If the operator observes a light </span>
                <span>transition from green to blue, the operator must interpret that light transition both in the context </span>
                <span>of the individual machine, and in relationship to the other machines on the line. Once both the </span>
                <span>observation and comprehension are archieved, the operator will determine, for example, that the </span>
                <span>wrapping machine is running low on film. Having made this determination, the operator will consider </span>
                <span>the level 3 needs of the situation, which consider how the current state will impact future status </span>
                <span>of the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0022] Continuing the example of the machine running low on film, the operator will likely consider how </span>
                <span>urgent the situation is. If an additional 15 minutes of production is expected following the </span>
                <span>alarm, the operator will consider this point when making a decision on a course of action.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0023] Understanding this basic model of situation awareness is a great benefit to designers. By </span>
                <span>understanding the basic thought process of the operator, and the relevant levels therein, </span>
                <span>the designer is left with only a few basic questions when evaluating a design. Will the </span>
                <span>operator see the stimulus I have designed? If the stimulus is provided on screen, is the </span>
                <span>intended focal point sufficiently salient, or is there other "digital noise" distracting </span>
                <span>the operator's attention from the critical indicator. Will the operator comprehend the feedback </span>
                <span>from the machine, or is the signal ambiguous, leaving the operator with a high level of </span>
                <span>uncertainty. Finally, does the machine simplify the operator's ability to predict the future </span>
                <span>outcome? Does the system warrant an explicit message communicating the time remaining until a </span>
                <span>critical system stoppage? When considering the appropriateness of the design, the designer </span>
                <span>can utilize the situation awareness model to help direct and evaluate potential solutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0024] In the next section of the guidance, we will begin by presenting the PackML Stack Light </span>
                <span>standard. Throughout the explanation of that standard, we will consider the associated </span>
                <span>aspects of usability and the components of the situational awareness model that are relevant </span>
                <span>in each aspect of its design. Once these concepts are considered in the simple context of </span>
                <span>stack lights, we will continue to the more complicated user-interface design domain.</span>

            <hr class="black"/>
            <h3>4.1 Scope</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0025] The implementation guidance in the area of stack lights and push-button controls </span>
                <span>offers a unique opportunity to illustrate the basic usability </span>
                <span>principles that will be essential in the far more flexible areas of the </span>
                <span>HMI (e.g., user-interface displays). Whereas stack lights are limited to...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a selection of colors</li>
                <li>in a particular order</li>
                <li>illuminated at a particular frequency based on the machine state</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <span>the graphical display portion of the HMI affords the designer a more limitless </span>
                <span>range of options, which, unfortunately, offers endless opportunities </span>
                <span>for the introduction of usability issues. Fortunately, the same simple principles that are inherent in </span>
                <span>the effective design of stack lights and control push-buttons will demonstrate the foundation </span>
                <span>of usability in the graphical interface. Discussing these principles in the </span>
                <span>more tangible context of stack lights and push-buttons may at first seem </span>
                <span>excessive, but, as we will discover, the design principles that produce optimal </span>
                <span>usability are quite simple and intuitive once they are understood and embraced. </span>
                <span>When applied to the graphical portion of the HMI, these principles will improve </span>
                <span>system usability, with minimal effort on the part of the designer.</span>

                <span>[0026] While the actual requirements necessary to specify the standardized PackML stack light </span>
                <span>and push-button implementations can be expressed in a few short paragraphs, we will offer a </span>
                <span>more verbose description that highlights the associated usability principles </span>
                <span>that are likely taken for granted.</span>

            <h3>4.2 Hierarchy, Orientation, Consistency, and Convention</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0028] Given the associated PackML states, the top-down orientation </span>
                <span>of the lights follows western cultural conventions where the </span>
                <span>most critical elements are positioned at the top. Here, the </span>
                <span>Stopped and Aborted states are presented at the top of the </span>
                <span>stack light, communicating their importance through their color </span>
                <span>(e.g., red or amber) and, perhaps more importantly, their </span>
                <span>position. The sequence attribute (i.e., flashing or solid) </span>
                <span>further communicates the urgency of the current state. It is </span>
                <span>accepted that the flashing light will draw more attention than a </span>
                <span>solid light, therefore, the flashing sequence is associated with </span>
                <span>the more urgent PackML states (e.g., Aborted is more urgent than </span>
                <span>Stopped). Here the attributes of color, position, and sequence </span>
                <span>represent hierarchy within the state model. Lights in a higher </span>
                <span>position are more urgent than those in a lower position, while </span>
                <span>lights that are flashing are more urgent than those that are </span>
                <span>solid. Similarly, through cultural convention, red is more urgent </span>
                <span>than amber. Hierarchy in the graphical interface will utilize </span>
                <span>these same attributes, as well as others, to establish focus, </span>
                <span>guiding the operator's attention to elements that are most </span>
                <span>essential to the task at hand.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0029] Given this summary, a key requirement of the proper application of the </span>
                <span>PackML stack light standard is an adherence to the specified light </span>
                <span>orientation. Across a given production line, it is essential that the order </span>
                <span>of the lights maintain the top-down orientation listed in Table 1. While the dual </span>
                <span>coding (i.e., color and position) within the standard would likely accommodate </span>
                <span>a mispositioned light (e.g., amber above red), such a violation would surely </span>
                <span>be a distraction to a line operator. It is expected that a focused color-sighted </span>
                <span>line operator could overcome a violation of the light position standard, however, </span>
                <span>under the additional stress of a line stoppage, a simple lack of consistency in </span>
                <span>light stack orientation could lead to an extended stoppage. Accordingly, we will </span>
                <span>highlight consistency in orientation as a key usability principle, one which will </span>
                <span>be revisited in the discussion on navigation design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0030] Moreover, it is essential that the color and sequence attributes of the </span>
                <span>associated stack lights be implemented in a consistent fashion within a single </span>
                <span>production facility. While an operator will most likely overcome some level of </span>
                <span>inconsistency in the size or color of the red stack lights across a number of </span>
                <span>machines in a single production line, a deviation in the frequency of a flashing </span>
                <span>light could draw undue attention to a single machine. A machine stack light </span>
                <span>flashing at a higher rate will draw more attention than surrounding machines </span>
                <span>blinking at a lower rate. Such scenarios should be avoided by establishing a </span>
                <span>standard flashing frequency within the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>These points illustrate the relevant distinction between internal and external consistency. </span>
                <span>Utilizing the same size and shape lenses within a single stack light of a given machine </span>
                <span>demonstrates the most basic application of internal consistency. A lack of consistency in a </span>
                <span>single light of the stack &ndash; a different shape or size, for example &ndash; would draw additional attention </span>
                <span>from the operator. This should be avoided unless the additional attention is a desirable effect. Conversely, using the same top-down </span>
                <span>sequence of colors in the PackML stack lights across a production line is a more </span>
                <span>critical example of external consistency. While not discussed in IEC 60204-1:2009, external consistency in the relative orientation of the </span>
                <span>push-button controls for Start, Stop, and Reset across machines is highly </span>
                <span>recommended. As with the light stack example &ndash; where color and position combine to communicate state &ndash; </span>
                <span>the dual coding of marking and positioning of push-buttons </span>
                <span>reduces the likelihood of error on the part of the operator. However, consider the impact of two adjacent machines </span>
                <span>where the orientation of the Start and Stop buttons are reveresed. While inconsistency in orientation should be avoided if possible, the optional introduction of color </span>
                <span>can aid the operator when positional consistency cannot be guaranteed. However, but any inconsistency in this orientation should be avoided if possible. Depending on the context, </span>
                <span>internal consistency can prove more critical than external consistency. </span>
                <span>Depending on the context, internal consistency can be more critical than external consistency. </span>
            </p>                
            <p>
                <span>Do keep in mind that consistency should be avoided if the underlying relationship does not hold. </span>
                <span>likewise be adopted across the production line.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>4.3 Proximity</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0031] Given the importance of the orientation principle, it is equally important that </span>
                <span>the PackML stack lights and push-button controls are positioned in a manner that effectively communicate </span>
                <span>their association with a given machine. While operator visibility is a key </span>
                <span>requirement for effective positioning, a stack light that is not sufficiently </span>
                <span>positioned with respect to the machine could fail to effectively communicate </span>
                <span>the PackML state. Moreover, a PackML stack light that is not consistently positioned </span>
                <span>within the relative body of the associated machine may not be appropriately identified </span>
                <span>if multiple stack lights with similar colors are present within the machine's proximity. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, it is recommended that the PackML stack lights are positioned such that a </span>
                <span>line operator with a view of the production line can consistently identify the PackML </span>
                <span>stack lights for each machine and correctly interpret the machine responsible for a </span>
                <span>line stoppage or held event.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>4.4 Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0032] While it is again expected that sufficient contrast will exist between a lit and </span>
                <span>unlit stack light, we will belabor the example to highlight the related design concept. </span>
                <span>Within a stack light, it is expected that an individual lamp will provide sufficient </span>
                <span>brightness to ensure that an operator can effectively distinguish between the lit and unlit states. </span>
                <span>Likewise, it is expected that the contrast between lamps (e.g., red to amber) is sufficient to ensure </span>
                <span>that the operator will </span> 
                <span>correctly, without hesitation, identify the actively lit lamp. It is important to note here </span>
                <span>that the operator's ability to interpret the correct lamp states is a function of both the </span>
                <span>the lights themselves (e.g., brightness, color) and the surrounding environment. Specifically it </span>
                <span>is critical to consider the operator's perspective when viewing the lamps. It is possible that the </span>
                <span>structures behind a stack light will impair the operator's ability to correctly perceive the active </span>
                <span>lamp. </span>
            </p>
            <h3>4.5 Speaking the Operator's Language</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0033] While it is reasonable to use the conventions of position, color, and sequence to draw </span>
                <span>an operator's attention to a given machine, it is still necessary to communicate the </span>
                <span>required course of action in a manner that speaks more directly and effectively to the </span>
                <span>operator. It is not sufficient to blink the blue light and expect the operator to know </span>
                <span>what action is necessary. The graphical interface must effectively communicate the </span>
                <span>meaning of the blinking blue light by presenting an instruction that leads to a prompt </span>
                <span>resolution.</span></p>
            <p>
                <span>[0034] Operators that have been drawn to a machine with an effective stack light indication should </span>
                <span>be greeted with a message they can appropriately identify and act upon. Hierarchy within the </span>
                <span>graphical interface is essential for this task. The approaching operator should quickly identify </span>
                <span>the required action when they scan the graphical interface. Instructions that lack prominence </span>
                <span>will delay the recovery of the production line. Lack of contrast and emphasis (e.g., size, boldness, </span>
                <span>color) will reduce the saliency of the operator instruction. Be sure the instruction presented to </span>
                <span>the operator is easily identified. Test the implementation to ensure the instructions are identified </span>
                <span>in a consistent manner.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0035] Avoiding generic instructions (e.g., HELD) in favor of machine specific instructions (e.g., Empty </span>
                <span>the Under Bin and Press Start) will expedite operator response and line recovery. Where appropriate, </span>
                <span>utilize conventions like Simplified English, which communicate to a broader audience through </span>
                <span>grammatical conventions. Avoid abbreviations, jargon, acronyms, and engineering-centric language, </span>
                <span>which will likely be lost on line operators. Reserve engineering conventions for log files, which </span>
                <span>will not require interpretation from line operators.</span>
